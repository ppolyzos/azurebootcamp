          "Description": "There’s a never-ending stream of cloud innovation that developers must know about, but at the same time confusion around all the different ways of building apps for the cloud. It’s not easy to put all these pieces together and see the \"big picture.\" When do you use PaaS versus IaaS? How should you handle all the data associated with your apps? Should you consider a Micro Service architecture or stick with something more traditional? This session is all about helping you make sense of Azure without drilling into any specific service. Gain a thorough understanding of the components of Azure and how you can take advantage of them as a developer.",
